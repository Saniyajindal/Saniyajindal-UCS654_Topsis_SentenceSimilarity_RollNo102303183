TOPSIS Analysis of Pre-trained Models for Sentence Similarity
This project compares multiple pre-trained NLP models for sentence similarity using TOPSIS.

Models evaluated:
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2
- all-mpnet-base-v2

Parameters considered:
- Similarity Score (maximize)
- Inference Time (minimize)
- Model Size (minimize)

TOPSIS is used to rank models based on overall performance.

Results are available in the results folder along with a comparison graph.
