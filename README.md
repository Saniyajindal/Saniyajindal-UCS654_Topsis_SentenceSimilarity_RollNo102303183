# TOPSIS Analysis of Pre-trained Models for Sentence Similarity

## 📌 Project Overview
This project compares multiple pre-trained NLP models for sentence similarity using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

## 🎯 Objective
To rank sentence similarity models based on:
- Similarity Score (maximize)
- Inference Time (minimize)
- Model Size (minimize)

## 🧠 Models Used
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2  
- paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2  
- all-mpnet-base-v2  

## 📊 Methodology
1. Compute similarity scores for sentence pairs  
2. Collect performance metrics  
3. Construct decision matrix  
4. Apply TOPSIS  
5. Rank models  

## 🏆 Results
Results are available in the `results` folder.

## 🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sentence-Transformers
